    "An **electrical fault** refers to any \"abnormal\" electrical current -- a short circuit, or a ground fault, etc. **Fault clearing** refers to the restoration of nominal electrical conditions to the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transient faults** (bird contact; lightning strike; temporary tree contact) can be cleared simply by \"turning the circuit on and off again.\" **Persistent faults** include mechanical damage to an underground power cable.\n",

    "----------\n",
    "In (three-phase?) transmission lines, electrical faults can be classified as *asymmetric* or *symmetric*. Asymmetric faults come in flavors:\n",
    " - (L-L) Line-to-line: a short-circuit between two lines (5-10%)\n",
    " - (L-G) Line-to-ground (65-70%)\n",
    " - (double L-G) Double line-to-ground: two lines come in contact with the ground (and each other? <- necessary condition??) )(15-20%)\n",
    " - (L-L-L) or (L-L-L-G) line-to-line-to-line (-to-ground) (2-5%). The system remains balanced (what are the implications?), but severe damage is possible.\n",
